#1 Requirement

## Convert Emoji Map (http://airairair.org/map) from Google Maps API to OSM using Openlayers v5.3.0.
Strong JavaScript developer who has experience working with OpenStreetMap's OpenLayers.   

1) start with file attached that's based on: https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/accessible.html  
2) Fullscreen: Button on top-right: https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/full-screen.html  
3) The URL must change as map is moved (permalink.html)  
4) The markers should be emojis just like on the Emoji Map - https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/icon.html  
5) the z-index for emoji pollutant severity 11 below 63. and fire + other should be set to "1" to be at bottom when others are on it. https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/layer-z-index.html  
6) set min and max zoom to prevent slow down of map due to too many emojis - https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/zoom-constrained.html  
7) the emojis should get smaller as you zoom out, and get larger as you zoom in - not linear, but in steps.  
8) data: openaq, NASA fires, open-data, etc. (But don't show fire emojis on mobile view.)  
9) map export to PNG - https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/export-map.html   
10) buttons with list of cities somewhere, e.g. delhi, beijing, kathmandu.  
11) when an emoji marker is clicked, show the existing popup from the live emoji map. Another option: use the alert("message") option. Can we put images and URLs in that popup?  
12) buttons below the map: Delhi, New York, Minneapolis, etc. using "Fly to Bern" code from the animations example: https://openlayers.org/en/v4.6.5/examples/animation.html
