Tell your buyer what you need to get started.

I'm a QGIS (v.3) user and I'm looking for somebody who can program a number of plugins which I need to fulfill my job. 
The first plugin I'm looking for - and I would like to use this as a test case because I'm new in this world - is a plugin that draws a set of lines from the corners of (a) rectangular shape(s) at a predefined angle and out to a predefined distance. This action should be performed on all shapes in a defined layer. I added a zip file with a number of shape files to illustrate what i'm looking for. First I have a layer with the rectangular shape (or a number of such rectangular shapes - possibly with different dimensions). The plugin needs to be capable to identify the "front" (side 1?) (you could say where the door is of the structure) because angles are different at this side than out from the "rear" of the structures.
From the "front" on the corners two sets of lines need to be drawn automatically. One set of lines from the two rear corners (angles and distances as shown in the added files). Is this possible? And if yes, what would be your price? Looking forward for receiving your advice. 
Kind regards, 
Johan
